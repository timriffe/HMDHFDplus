\title{readHMDweb a basic HMD data grabber.}
\usage{
readHMDweb(
  CNTRY,
  item,
  username,
  password,
  fixup = TRUE,
  validate_items = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CNTRY}{character vector. HMD country letter codes. If not spelled
right, or not specified, an interactive menu is offered (if possible).}

\item{item}{character vector. HMD item code(s), e.g. \code{"fltper_1x1"}.
If missing and interactive, you can select from items available in at
least one selected country.}

\item{username}{character. HMD username (usually your email).}

\item{password}{character. HMD password.}

\item{fixup}{logical. If TRUE, pass the downloaded table through
\code{HMDparse()} for convenience.}

\item{validate_items}{logical. If TRUE (default), item codes are validated
against the union of items available across the selected countries.}
}
\value{
If a single item ends up with available data: a data.frame (possibly stacked
over multiple countries, with \code{PopName} as the first column when more
than one country is requested).

If multiple items end up with available data: a named list of such
data.frames, one per item.

Output is returned invisibly.

\description{
Basic HMD data grabber, based on Carl Boe's original \code{HMD2R()}.
It can grab one or more HMD statistical products, possibly for multiple
countries, using a single login session.

Typical pitfalls are removed: the Age column is coerced to integer, while an
AgeInterval column is created. Population counts are placed into two columns
for Jan. 1 and Dec. 31 of the same year, so as to remove headaches from
population universe adjustments. Argument \code{fixup} is outsourced to
\code{HMDparse()}.
